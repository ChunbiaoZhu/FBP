## Abstract

 	
Automatic Salient object detection has received tremendous attention from research community and has been an increasingly
important tool in many computer vision tasks. This paper proposes a novel bottom-up salient object detection
framework which considers both foreground and background cues. First, A series of background and foreground seeds
are extracted from an image reliably, and then used for calculation
of saliency map separately. Next, a combination of
foreground and background saliency map is performed. Last,
a refinement step based on geodesic distance is utilized to
enhance salient regions, thus deriving the final saliency map.
Particularly we provide a robust scheme for seeds selection
which contributes a lot to accuracy improvement in saliency
detection. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method against other outstanding
methods.
